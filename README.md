=================

Code examples and slides for Drupalcamp London views session

(NOTE: Most definitely NOT production code! Just a demo)

Contains:

1. 2 demo modules: shop, twitter_search

2. SQL to populate the tables created in the shop module - shop_data.sql
(note it's the *bare minimum* of test data! Just so you can import it
and see everything working out of the box).

3. Presentation slides (in .pptx format)

The Twitter API wrapper comes from here btw: https://github.com/J7mbo/twitter-api-php
